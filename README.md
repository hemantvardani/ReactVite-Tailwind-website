# ReactVite-Tailwind-website

***Complete Description of Assignment***

By Hemant Vardani

I built the project assigned by Violet Tech Leanx within 24 hours. As the Time limit was there, I
did as much as possible within that time.
Note: Before being assigned to this project, I didn’t have knowledge of either Tailwind or
React Vite as they both are less conventional( Though I knew the complete MERN stack).
Hence within these 24 hours, I first learned both Tailwind and React Vite, then implemented.
Hence, I believe that this shows my adaptability and quick learning skills, along with my
previous MERN stack knowledge, using which I built this project.
